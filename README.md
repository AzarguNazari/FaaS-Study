# FaaS-Study
Cloud service providers offer their services in form of as-a-service such as:
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Container as a Service (CaaS)
- Backend as a Service (BaaS)
- Function as a Service (FaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

Each of these services have different level of abstraction to access the underlying resource network. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offer a very low-level service and put all the burden of managing virtual machine to users and most of the cases, users don't want to have this responsiblity of managing servers, instead they want to focus on development of code. Here comes the FaaS use cases where it makes the DevOps to NoOps and remove the burden of managing server from users, instead users can only focus on the development of code. 
Through FaaS, you can run your application by uploading the zip of source code to the FaaS platform and everything else will be managed by FaaS provider or FaaS platform. Let's say, we want to develop an application for a new start up company, instead of choosing other services, FaaS is a an excellent choice to make new start up application happen faster and less cost of running the application. Yes, FaaS costs less compare to other platforms because you pay as per function call, instead of paying for running the entire server. 

Almost all the public cloud services provide FaaS, such as AWS Labmda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, etc. Even open source FaaS platforms are available such as OpenFaaS, OpenWhisk, Serverless, etc. The trend to using FaaS is increasing and majority of the companies which are using cloud services are tending to migration to FaaS due to FaaS's unique features.
